# Foundation-Mix
### Boilerplate for Foundation for Sites &amp; Laravel Mix

Since [Foundation for Sites](https://get.foundation/sites) seems to be no longer maintained, you may still have websites that runs with it. In a modern Node.js / npm environment, the provided compilers are pretty useless by now.

With the support of [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com) it doesn't take much to get the old Foundation application up and running again until your customer orders a complete rewrite of the frontend-code.

This repo includes SASS/JS examples of a [modal dialog](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/reveal.html), [dropdown menu](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/dropdown-menu.html ) and [accordion](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/accordion.html).
